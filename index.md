## Robotic Arm Group Side Project


Please press the GitHub button in the top right to see the code. The project is a 4-axis robotic arm that I worked on in a team of 3. I was responsible for the software portion of the project as well as managing the group. The main components of the project include the circuitry, 3D design, the Arduino (C++), and the Android App (Java).
